A book about how to quit smoking, describes how as long as not smoking is a limitation; quitting comes when you internalize that it is liberating. This perceptive shift is a key in any efforts to change our habitual behavior. 

Amazon Web Services data centers occupy 33% of cloud infrastructure, obscured through subsidiary contracts and NDAs. (We know that Vadata, Amazon’s proxy for managing data center shells, is the second-largest tenant of the largest third-party data center developer, Corporate Office Property Trust. Its largest tenant is the US government.) 

At the moment, the server runs on a 30W solar panel and a 168 Wh lead-acid battery. For a period of about one year (351 days, from 12 December 2018 to 28 November 2019), we achieved an uptime of 95.26%)

My generation, and those after us, are staring down a ravaged environment, eviscerated institutions, and the increasing erosion of democracy. In this context, the long-term view is as seductive as the apolitical, inward turn of the communards from the nineteen-sixties.
